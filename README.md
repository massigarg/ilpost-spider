## Il Post - Scrapy Spider

This is a Scrapy spider for the Italian newspaper Il Post. It gets all the World headlines and abstracts in a .json or .csv . A sentiment feature has been added for future analysis using an Hugging Face transformer for non english text (nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment).

The project can be expanded for different sections of the newspaper and a sentiment analysis.
